      <p>Data recorded and published by the Minneapolis police department (MPD) reveals disproportionate discriminatory conduct by officers. MPD officers use excessive force, according to the Department of Justice, and do so predominantly against Native American and Black civilians.</p>

      <p>Paul Boxer, professor of psychology at Rutgers University-Newark, co-authored a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33948965/">commissioned report</a> on inappropriate police use of force. The report, written from a behavioral and social science perspective, addresses how police use of force incidents disproportionately impact communities of color.</p>

      <p> “[The need for the report] really came to a head with the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis,” Boxer said.</p>

      <p>In 2020, ex-officer <a href="https://apnews.com/article/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-prison-stabbing-f24cde6aa28877d034530c2dc40ef7ea">Derek Chauvin</a> killed Floyd with what the MPD dataset lists as the “maximal restraint technique.” A bystander documented the murder. The video sparked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/world/asia/george-floyd-protest-global.html">international outrage</a> and ignited the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-floyd-black-lives-matter-impact/">Black Lives Matter</a> movement.</p>

      <p>“Minneapolis is only the latest, sort of, high-profile situation for this problem,” Boxer said. “It’s not an outlier.”</p>

      <p>Boxer’s report examined police departments across the country and beyond. He noted similarities between East Coast police departments and the MPD.</p>

      <p>“<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/newark-n-j-wants-be-model-police-reform-black-people-n1234190">Newark, New Jersey</a> has had this issue. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-investigation-new-york-city-police-department-s-special-victims">New York City</a> has had this issue where the DOJ has had to come in and try and right some wrongs,” Boxer said. “But I have yet to see a city held up as a shining example of bias-free policing, which is sad.”</p>

      <p>The goal of the report was to “identify some ways in which society can move towards research-supported solutions” and “lay out an agenda for researchers interested in studying the topic,” Boxer said.</p>

      <p>The report offers five recommendations to society. The first is for public policy officers to adjust regulations and policies — which permit certain actions by police — to reduce police use of force.</p>

      <p>It recommends reducing police burdens by designating trained professionals to deal with situations such as mental health crises.</p>

      <p>“There are communities and instances where police are tasked with taking on roles of social workers or psychiatrists,” Boxer said. “The police certainly can help out in those situations, but really, those are activities that might be better dealt with by professionals who are trained specifically to do those kinds of things.”</p>

      <p>The report recommends improving and increasing the quantity and delivery of “non-coercive conflict resolution tactics,” or making sure officers can handle difficult situations using verbal skills.</p>

      <p>Boxer said many interventions have been put in place to reduce bias and the disproportionate impact on minority groups.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://trustandjustice.org/">National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice</a> worked to improve relations between six police departments and the communities they serve. The initiative provided police officers with interventions such as anger management training. Boxer said none of the departments in the study responded effectively.</p>

      <p>“I was actually very surprised to discover, at the time of the George Floyd situation, that Minneapolis was one of the cities included in that study. Trying specifically to reduce the likelihood of something bad happening in a police-suspect interaction. It’s very ironic,” Boxer said.</p>

      <p>Researchers observed “no breaks in the trends for use of force incidents by race” by the MPD across more than six years of analysis, according to a <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/100704/national_initiative_for_building_community_trust_and_justice_6.pdf">brief</a> of the findings.</p>

      <p>Boxer’s report recommends continuing to develop evidence-based and field-tested interventions for police departments, and to expand research in the behavioral social sciences field.</p>

      <p>The Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-civil-rights-violations-minneapolis-police-department-and-city">announced</a> in June that the MPD engages in conduct that violates the constitution.</p>

      <p>The DOJ conducted a comprehensive investigation of the MPD and found that officers use excessive force, unlawfully discriminate against Black and Native American people, violate civilians’ rights to protected speech, and discriminate against people with behavioral health disabilities.</p>

      <p>“George Floyd’s death had an irrevocable impact on his family, on the Minneapolis community, on our country, and on the world,” Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in the press release. “The patterns and practices of conduct the Justice Department observed during our investigation are deeply disturbing…they made what happened to George Floyd possible.”</p>

      <p>Boxer’s report utilizes critical race theory to examine discriminatory police conduct.</p>

      <p>“When you look at it from that perspective, [you] understand that disproportionate police use of force on minority communities isn't just a police problem...but it is a broader societal problem that is really baked into our system of laws and governance,” Boxer said.</p>

      <p>It's important to look at the history of the police, Boxer said, as “[modern police systems] emanated from slave patrols, where Black slaves were chased down if they were trying to escape,” he said.</p>

      <p>Boxer said it’s been an open secret for a while — that Minneapolis has had this challenge — but its police department just keeps not getting better.</p>

<p>“When you see the same pattern of problem behavior, showing itself over and over again, for such a protracted amount of time, at some point, someone has to say… ‘Look, the system. This isn't working,’” Boxer said.</p>
